CSCI 103 Programming Assignment 4, Social Network Part 1, Fall 2014

: I asked for one of the female TA's advice about how to error check the widest
range of issues when reading in the network file during my Friday 2pm lab
section. She told me that I was doing more than what was necessary, but that I
should get creative with my constrictors, which was helpful. I also got help
from David Pritchard during his office hours about how to parse strings and
move tasks into public class functions.

================================ Remarks ====================================

Filling in anything here is OPTIONAL.

Approximately how long did you spend on this assignment?

: It seemed like I spent a really long time on this assignment, especially in
comparison to the others. This might be because I was playing with and learning
about new objects like string streams and vectors, and I kept changing my mind
about how I was going to divide up functions.  A rough estimate of time spent
actually working on it is like 7-10hrs, maybe.

Were there any specific problems you encountered? This is especially useful to
know if you turned it in incomplete.

: I didn't have any major or specific issues, just the usual debugging.

Do you have any other remarks?

: Nope.
